# Data-Visualization-Project-Life-Satisfaction-vs-GDP-Per-Capita
Recreated the visualization on https://data.world/makeovermonday/2020w11-self-reported-life-satisfaction-vs-gdp-per-capita, and improved on the visualization. A project for my STAT 4380: Data Science class.
I worked on this project with Julia Shmookler and Jack Merecki, who mainly worked on the improved visualization.
